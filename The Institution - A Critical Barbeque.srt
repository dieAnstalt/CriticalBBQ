1
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,340
<i>The Institution</i>

2
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,060
Tell me, Herr von Wagner

3
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,190
You said we were just having a normal football evening

4
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:54,780
We are,

5
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,750
but we wanted to look at the problems in our host country, you know?

6
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,400
A kind of critical barbeque

7
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:07,170
The state of the sausages really is critical

8
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,580
Do you understand, critical?

9
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,620
We are FIFA

10
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,130
Ah, the Freetime Institute for Foolish Agitators

11
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,200
What?

12
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,640
No, we are For Investigative Football Appreciation

13
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,220
You see?

14
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,020
Not just seeing football, but seeing through it

15
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,010
A typical Wagner trick

16
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,440
What's the limbo rod there for?

17
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:30,630
It symbolises, of course, the contortions Brazil is doing just to host this event

18
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,840
What's that tulip picker doing here?

19
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,500
He symbolises the beauty

20
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,720
of football

21
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,260
And someone's got to lose

22
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:03,930
In Holland, we showed Geert Wilders the art of losing

23
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,820
You taught the AfD ["Neonazi" party] how to win

24
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,840
Sorry, but why is she there?

25
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,300
For the stadium atmosphere, or what?

26
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,460
Wait a minute, Uthoff

27
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:23,430
World Cup 2003, European Cup 2005

28
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:29,580
World Cup 2007, European Cup 2009 and 2013

29
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,460
Those are all uneven numbers

30
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,220
There weren't any world cups

31
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,920
I'm talking about women's football

32
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,950
You know, maybe it's easier to win without

33
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,290
a second striker

34
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,680
Uthoff

35
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,500
You definitely drew the short straw there

36
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,600
Come, let's watch the pre-match commentary

37
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,100
No!

38
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:04,900
Yes!

39
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,060
Then at least then we'll see the Dutch players a bit

40
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,520
No, we can't watch football yet

41
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,860
We haven't been critical

42
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,480
Football and critical thinking don't go together anyway

43
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,600
Of course they do

44
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:14,920
You see,

45
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,740
The fundamental idea of football is freedom

46
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,280
Who says that?

47
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,220
Uli Hoeneß? [football player and tax evader]

48
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,820
Cesar Luis Benotti

49
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,440
Argentinian coach, '74-'83

50
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,560
That's it

51
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,640
He wasn't just a football trainer, but a critical spirit

52
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,920
Because he was a chain smoker?

53
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,180
No, after the world cup of '78,

54
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,700
he refused to shake the dictator's hand

55
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,120
Because he had a cigarette in his hand?

56
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,320
No, out of political consciousness

57
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,120
Argentina '78?

58
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,440
Couldn't find any critical football thinkers in 2014?

59
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,440
Of course, there are many critical footballers

60
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,400
There's...

61
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,760
V... Völler!

62
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,340
He almost hit a Dutchman once

63
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,400
Hey, Conchita, throw us a sausage

64
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,020
Herr Uthoff...

65
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,940
Sausage jokes have a beard this long

66
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,540
Here, your critical sausage

67
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,240
Yes, I can see that

68
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,820
but where is the meat?

69
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,660
It's vegan

70
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,220
So you're a Turkey sympathiser?

71
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,840
Come on, let's start

72
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,840
We will start with a documentary about the seamstress at Adidas

73
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,440
Not that!

74
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,660
Have they even qualified?

75
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,520
We want to watch football!

76
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,700
How can you watch football

77
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,580
if you don't even know what it costs?

78
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,200
But it's on free TV!

79
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,160
We still have to bet!

80
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,020
Oh yes!

81
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,840
I bet if you examine the details of this world cup for half an hour

82
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,440
you won't want to watch it

83
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,460
I'll bet on that

84
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,900
If I lose interest in football,

85
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,900
I'll wear your limbo hat

86
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,780
And if I win, I'll take my jersey off

87
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,600
And I'll help you

88
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,640
What?

89
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,920
If I lose,

90
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,400
I'll walk through Amsterdam in your jersey

91
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,380
Excellent

92
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,140
Then let's start with the strongest argument there is:

93
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,960
FIFA

94
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:49,240
I love the smell of napalm on Tuesday evening

95
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,480
I told you the state of the sausages was critical

96
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,520
Good day

97
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:54,940
Hi

98
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,760
I'm your FIFA partner

99
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,360
Here's my card

100
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,220
"Last night was nice,

101
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,500
call me, Yvonne."

102
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,640
"Treter:

103
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,680
Football executioner"

104
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,860
Football executive

105
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,900
This is my partner

106
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,520
The world cup mascot

107
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,260
He's an armadillo

108
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,080
Yellow, blue

109
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,320
and endangered

110
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,100
Like the FDP Party

111
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,120
Tell me,

112
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,020
what's he called?

113
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,200
A mixture of football and ecological

114
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,500
It symbolises the esteem we have for our host country

115
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,120
Wait a minute, fuleco is Brazillian

116
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,020
for "arse"

117
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,160
Correct

118
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,760
And what are you doing here?

119
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,940
Well, what does it look like

120
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:42,760
Well

121
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,720
Billows of smoke,

122
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,900
a Dutchman,

123
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,240
and two overzealous lefties

124
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,800
trying to impress the village beauty

125
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,180
Is this about canabis legalisation?

126
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,340
No!

127
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,000
Listen, we're having a critical barbeque

128
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,300
So, a political event?

129
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:58,680
Yes sir!

130
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,060
We want to use football's popularity for social change

131
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,400
You know, in the tradition of Minotti and...

132
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:04,720
Völler

133
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,480
Exactly

134
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,160
FIFA la revolution

135
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,680
That banner overhead,

136
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,400
that has to go

137
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,360
Why?

138
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,960
FIFA and overheads?

139
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,500
That doesn't go together

140
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,980
And what does it even mean?

141
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,100
Oh, that's the slogan of the Brazilians opposing this world cup

142
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,100
It means, "There will be no world cup"

143
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,940
Then the screen will stay blank

144
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,820
Al Capone said

145
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,460
I mean, Joseph Blatter said

146
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,920
we need to protect our sport from political influence

147
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,880
Then Merkel's not allowed in the stands?

148
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,100
No, you can't protest here anymore

149
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:54,960
What?

150
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,080
You have to decide

151
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,320
Either football

152
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,960
or this Christian barbeque

153
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,180
OK, then no question

154
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,020
Then no football for a few weeks, right, men?

155
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,760
No...  But we want...

156
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,200
Now look what I have here

157
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,600
You can have fun without watching football!

158
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,440
But we can be critical at half time...

159
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,920
Stop!

160
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,380
Where is your solidarity for the people of Brazil?

161
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,920
Brazil is getting something out of it!

162
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,740
Modern streets are being built

163
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,340
People are pouring into the...

164
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,340
slums

165
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,640
Look, they've spent €3 billion on stadiums

166
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,900
Those were all private investments

167
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,980
That's what they told the people

168
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,840
And now the state has paid everything

169
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,300
And the private investors

170
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:44,980
0 cent

171
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,580
That's it

172
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,800
And they don't need stadiums,

173
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,180
they need hospitals and schools

174
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,000
Fat Renaldo said

175
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,700
you can't play football in hospitals

176
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,720
And he's an expert

177
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,680
Listen to me

178
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,320
They're building enormous stadiums,

179
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,160
some for 3rd-league clubs

180
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,380
You don't build an Allianz Arena for Wacker Burghausen!

181
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,100
Why not?

182
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,280
I'll spur them on to get out of this misery

183
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,440
Great, useless stadiums for VIPS

184
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,940
and the people are sitting in the shit

185
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,700
Herr von Wagner,

186
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,700
you're becoming vulgar

187
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,360
Half of all Brazillian households

188
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,860
don't have running water

189
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,600
Holy shit

190
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
Precisely

191
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,220
170,000 people were forced to relocate

192
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,640
They had to leave their homes forever

193
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,840
so we can watch two weeks of football

194
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,960
And what's FIFA doing?

195
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,340
Making money

196
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,200
€4 billion profit

197
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,580
Do you want to watch football or not?

198
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,560
No!

199
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,580
How awful

200
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,340
We're becoming champions and I can't see it

201
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,560
But the stadiums were already there

202
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,060
Otherwise those people would have died for n...

203
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,120
Herr von Wagner

204
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,760
I really do always have an ear for the underprivileged

205
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:57,120
But I need a break every 4 years

206
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,900
You know what?

207
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,320
That

208
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,240
is not why we occupied this Institution

209
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,380
You see, you only get emotions like these with football

210
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,880
You won't regret it

211
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,500
After the first kick,

212
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,420
all your problems will be forgotten

213
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,120
Maybe Herr von Wagner is right

214
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,080
Football and politics can go together

215
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,480
It only depends

216
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,940
who you kick

217
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,920
Look at this, for example

218
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,180
The Turkish vice head of state, Yakel,

219
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,700
with a beautiful drop kick against a protester

220
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,760
His team manager, Erdogan, took him straight out of the lineup

221
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,580
because he hadn't understood the most important criterea for joining the EU:

222
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,740
"Don't kick

223
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,320
Have other people do it for you"

224
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,320
Europe

225
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,140
Europe has voted, and the result is not surprising

226
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,500
When you spend years ignoring large differences in income

227
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,180
Years holding onto an brutal austerity policy

228
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,460
It's no wonder

229
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,540
when the lower-income

230
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,000
and now even higher-income bracket in Northern Europe

231
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,140
fall into the hands of hand-picked scum

232
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,580
like Orbán and LePenn

233
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,560
The British don't want to play anymore, maybe

234
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,560
But who wants the British

235
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,480
Yes, they do have a good sense of humour

236
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,740
They need it, with their looks

237
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,600
The choice

238
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,880
The choice between Martin Schulz and Jean-Claude Schulz

239
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,280
electrified the people

240
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,240
like licking an old 1.5V battery

241
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,040
Just before the election, Martin Schulz told people to vote

242
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,960
to drown out the voice of the right-wing populists

243
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,600
And at the same time,

244
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,500
has his postcard face printed on billboards

245
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,140
garnished with the slogan:

246
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,220
"From Germany, for Europe"

247
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,720
Then, at the latest, you understand why casting a vote

248
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,780
always sounds a bit like having no voice

249
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,920
The provincial character of this election

250
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,800
can bee seen particularly clearly in this picture:

251
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:40,340
<i>[Asparagus]</i>

252
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:48,240
But at least everyone elligible to vote obeyed the golden rule of every election:

253
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,340
"One man - one vote"

254
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,380
Everyone

255
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,600
except

256
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,000
Giovanni di Lorenzo

257
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,680
The chief editor of the weekly paper Die Zeit

258
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,080
admitted before millions of viewers

259
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,880
that he voted twice

260
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,920
Once in the Italian consulate

261
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,180
and once in a primary school in Hamburg

262
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,180
Although we all know,

263
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,880
if only from Monty Python's "The Life of Brian",

264
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,460
only one cross each

265
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,560
Enough about the shortage of skilled workers

266
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,680
The public prossecution department is investigating election fraud

267
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,060
Ukraine voted too

268
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,820
The changing of the oligarch

269
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,040
Now we have one dipped in chocolate

270
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,820
Taste: bittersweet

271
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,760
The new oligarch has already stated

272
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,360
his plans to visit the regions in crisis in the east

273
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,400
And yesterday, to be on the safe side,

274
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,980
he sent the military ahead of him

275
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,640
The process of reconciliation has begun

276
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,780
Score at half time:

277
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,340
More than 50 dead

278
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,800
But the road has to be cleared

279
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,080
for western investors

280
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,660
The American VP's son, Hunter Biden,

281
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,960
is already indentured

282
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:07,500
in the board of the Ukranian gas and energy corporation Burisma

283
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,120
And if you say,

284
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,460
"But you can't do that

285
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,800
Dealing out the silver before the body's cold"

286
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,940
They'll tell you:

287
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,080
I'm curious if Frank Walter Steinmeier

288
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,040
will maybe get angry about this as well

289
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,820
Listen to me,

290
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,300
I'm in the middle of my solo!

291
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,920
Herr Uthoff

292
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,920
You may have forgotten

293
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,340
ZDF is a FIFA partner

294
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,500
You're obliged

295
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:41,960
to give the mascot screen time at any moment

296
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,720
You know, I've heard that armadillos

297
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,160
are endangered

298
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,300
He's getting so worked up

299
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,680
People in our profession are expected to get worked up

300
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,800
But privately I've given it up

301
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,200
"Laid-back" is the new catchword

302
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,900
If we can learn one thing from our chancellor,

303
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,820
it's how to be laid-back

304
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,580
Pity she won't share her potato soup recipe

305
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,320
But everything is great

306
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,040
Crises?

307
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,500
Ah, that'll pass

308
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,960
There are things you can hold on to

309
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,640
Thing which always stay the same

310
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,300
Lothar Mattäus has just got a kid

311
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,880
on that Russian bimbo

312
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,660
Something like that stabilises you

313
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,240
Maybe one day Schröder will adopt her

314
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,460
out of solidarity with Russia

315
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,280
Laid-back

316
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,220
It's also true of Burger King

317
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,540
I bet they'll soon have a massive turnover

318
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,760
Heidi Klum just needs to say

319
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,380
that she can lose 15 kilos quickly and easily

320
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,520
with foodpoisoning

321
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,620
"My burger's not stale, it's slim-fast!"

322
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,040
Everything is wonderful

323
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,180
Yes, look!

324
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,640
There are just a few catches

325
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,400
like retirement at 63 or 93

326
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,080
But let's be honest

327
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,160
With the state of our retirement homes

328
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,760
Everyone works there voluntarily anyway

329
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,000
until they kick the bucket

330
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,140
And if you don't want to anymore,

331
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,520
with 60 a Rex Gildo, 6th floor, and basta

332
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,300
We're heading towards a great time

333
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,560
Look, after a few years of war in the Ukraine

334
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,920
we'll have prime conditions for an economic miracle in Eastern Europe

335
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,560
In Germany it'll rain money

336
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,040
Greece will reopen the euro rescue parachute

337
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,900
And Erdogan will be driven out by his own people

338
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,920
And together with Silvio Berlusconi, in a Roman retirement home,

339
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,620
will read his biography aloud

340
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,220
to retired strippers

341
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,040
"Inshallah: Between baton and Koran"

342
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,240
Sepp Blatter, after one look from Sahra Wagenknecht,

343
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,480
cools football stadiums in Qatar down to -16 degrees

344
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,180
Tebartz van Elst [Catholic priest]

345
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,980
has to give up his swanky home

346
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,400
and move in with his children

347
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,820
And Annette Schavan

348
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,660
Annette Schavan holds up the Vatacan

349
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,000
and ends 1000-year-old dogmas

350
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,580
to make one thing possible:

351
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:13,420
the canonisation of our living European dictator,

352
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,400
Angela Merkel

353
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,240
And Saint Angela pilgrims devoutly

354
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,520
to Frankfurt, to the German banking centre

355
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,300
and kneels at the grave

356
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,320
of the unknown banker

357
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,080
I can't wait

358
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,760
Do you have your cards?

359
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,300
Yeah, let's trade!

360
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,080
I have an album

361
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,020
Can I see?

362
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,880
OK

363
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,920
I have Don Julio Grondona

364
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,020
What curruption score does he have?

365
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,780
7/10 on the Blatter scale

366
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,980
He's very good at money laundering, tax evasion and...

367
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,160
It says corruption

368
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,880
€70 million in slush funds

369
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,960
Not bad!

370
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,220
And what's his statement score?

371
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,100
9/10

372
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,880
What did he say?  Give here

373
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,180
"I don't think that a Jewish referee can be on the same level

374
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,600
Because it's hard work, and we know

375
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,260
Jews don't like hard work"

376
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,340
Um, is that bad?

377
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,340
He got the FIFA Order of Merit

378
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,540
It can't be that bad

379
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,160
I also have a right-winger

380
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,540
Arjen Robben

381
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,960
But he didn't even get a yellow card last season!

382
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,900
I have Jack Warner

383
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,920
Where did he play?

384
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,380
He was in the FIFA...

385
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,260
executive committee

386
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,100
And he has a way high curruption score, look!

387
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:14,280
He built a training centre for €25 million

388
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,280
That's not even illegal!

389
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,440
It is on your private property

390
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,160
Also...

391
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,380
He tried to buy votes in the FIFA presidential election

392
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,980
But everyone does that

393
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:28,660
Yeah

394
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,820
But not votes against Sepp Blatter

395
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,880
He also got himself caught

396
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,720
Look who I have

397
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,500
Jérôme Valcke!

398
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,360
Is he still playing?

399
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,760
Of course, stupid

400
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,100
He's the second most important, after Blatter

401
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,080
They once did some really naughty stuff

402
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,660
FIFA had to pay a €90m fine

403
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,980
Because he cheated

404
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,300
a FIFA sponsor, Mastercard

405
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,800
with Visa

406
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,540
With Lisa?

407
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,040
But my dad said they fired him

408
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,700
They did

409
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,040
And rehired him after 6 months

410
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,060
As a caretaker?

411
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,620
No, as secretary general

412
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,800
A man secretary!

413
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,160
I have two of this one

414
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,840
José Maria Marin

415
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,020
He has an awesome dictatorship score

416
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,080
Robben, too

417
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,000
Rubbish

418
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,020
Has too, he played for 4 years under Mourinho

419
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:30,640
Look, that's nothing compared to Marin

420
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,360
He has insanely...

421
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,840
Look!

422
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,180
The blood of a dictatorship is on his hands

423
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:45,200
And it's allegedly his fault that a journalist was turtured and murdered

424
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,040
And what's he going now?

425
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,720
He's preparing for the world cup in Brazil

426
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
He'll be at the opening

427
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,360
Next to the president, Dilma Rousseff

428
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,100
Do they love each other?

429
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,100
I dunno...

430
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,460
But I don't think so

431
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,220
Because Rousseff once had a husband

432
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,560
and he was tortured in that dictatorship

433
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,460
And Marin approved of it

434
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,420
And then she has to sit next to him at the opening?

435
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,000
Yeah

436
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,420
But FIFA alway says,

437
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,220
"Football brings people together"

438
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,440
Guess who I have here?

439
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,320
Carlos Alberto Lacoste

440
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,600
What's so great about him?

441
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:31,060
Listen, he organised the world cup in Argentina, during the military dictatorship

442
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,180
And Argentina desperately wanted to win

443
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,840
Then they said to Peru,

444
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,840
"If you win,

445
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,520
we'll give you heaps of money

446
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,520
and torture your political enemies"

447
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,780
Evil

448
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,880
And then?

449
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,100
Then, Peru lost and Argentina became world champions

450
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:57,120
Against Holland

451
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,520
That's mean!

452
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,580
Did they at least throw him in a dirty hole?

453
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,860
You could say that

454
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,320
He became FIFA vice president

455
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,260
Although he'd been a dictator

456
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,560
In a dictatorship where 30,000 people died

457
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,880
- Evil!
- Yeah, evil

458
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,880
If Blatter knew...

459
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,820
Yeah...

460
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,820
Hello, children

461
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,080
Uncle Blatter knows everything

462
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,660
He recently said, about this matter in Argentina,

463
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,500
"I was happy that Argentina won

464
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,580
Between the population and the political system,

465
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,620
there was a kind of reconciliation"

466
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,620
Evil...

467
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,120
Children?

468
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,580
I have something for you here

469
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,440
Joseph Blatter!

470
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,860
He doesn't look very nice

471
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:50,400
Yeah, my mum said he has a yucky infection

472
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,400
Can I have him?

473
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,800
No, no one can get him

474
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:59,100
You only get him when you've bought all the others

475
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,700
Hey Uncle do you have pictures of the builders?

476
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,600
Who died on the construction sites in Qatar?

477
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,860
But they don't have any faces

478
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:24,420
Hey Uncle, what class are you in?

479
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:28,080
I'm a FIFA official

480
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,520
And you?

481
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,020
Aren't you afraid of me?

482
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,140
No

483
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,240
I've got Snowden

484
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,760
It's funny

485
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,500
No one wants to keep him

486
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,240
But the guy's a hero

487
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,920
When he started to consider exposing the NSA

488
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,680
he was in his late 20s

489
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,260
He was getting a 6-digit salary from the NSA, I think

490
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,540
Was living in Hawaii with his girlfriend

491
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,620
And she was, I quote,

492
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,280
"A good-looking dancer"

493
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,720
A good-looking dancer!  In Hawaii!

494
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,400
For that life,

495
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,120
I would not only have sold my grandmother to the NSA,

496
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,540
but left her bound and gagged outside their headquarters

497
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,680
And what did Snowden do?

498
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,580
He sacrificed this freedom

499
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,860
to warn us of the threat to ours

500
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,120
And what have we done with this sacrifice?

501
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:47,100
We got Pofalla onto it

502
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,020
He was the one who whiped the affair from the table

503
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,020
OK, when they tapped the Chancellor's phone,

504
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,340
he reacted at once

505
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:03,100
Set the Facebook relationship status with America

506
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,500
to "it's complicated"

507
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,100
Then the Chancellor intervened, said "That's not OK!"

508
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,860
And she called in the American embassy

509
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:14,940
That was the harshest diplomatic action available to us

510
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,700
One hour, alone

511
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,280
with Guido Westerwelle [minister of foreign affairs]

512
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,660
When that proved fruitless,

513
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,900
the politicians went en masse to Washington,

514
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,600
hopping mad

515
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,020
Recently De Maizière again

516
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,380
De Maizière went hopping mad to Washington,

517
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,780
came back with the realisation,

518
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,940
"Snowden is a criminal"

519
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:34,820
And now we're supposed to have a "cyber dialogue" with the USA

520
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,960
A cyber dialogue!

521
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,460
What is that?

522
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:40,300
The NSA is now going to call us back?

523
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,380
Nonetheless

524
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,560
Nonetheless, we now have an NSA investigation committee

525
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,980
And our government is doing everything in its power

526
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,260
to obstruct their work

527
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,260
And that's why they've now decided

528
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,540
to question Snowden

529
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,000
Only they forgot to clarify

530
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,960
where

531
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,340
and how, and what, and why

532
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,860
out of fear that Obama will get angry

533
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,120
That's

534
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,600
manifold violations of fundamental rights

535
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,520
What are those

536
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,340
compared to the raised eyebrows of an American president?

537
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,540
That's anchored in our constitution:

538
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,580
"A person's dignity is inviolable

539
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:24,100
Details are regulated by an American law"

540
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,520
When

541
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,380
Thank you very much

542
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,080
If the government really refuses to get Snowden over here,

543
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,080
to really question him properly,

544
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,980
out of fear that the NSA wouldn't work with us anymore,

545
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:43,840
this country is saying very clearly

546
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,460
The work of spies is more important to us

547
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,140
than the constitution

548
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,240
But I can understand that

549
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,820
Spies are sexy

550
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,840
The constitution is 65

551
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:56,980
And maybe the government isn't that afraid of the Americans

552
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,180
Maybe they're more afraid of Edward Snowden

553
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,080
and his remarks about

554
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,820
the unconstitutional conduct

555
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,960
of the BND [German intelligence]

556
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,200
Maybe that would raise more questions

557
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,580
than the government is prepared to answer

558
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,200
It's quite funny that no one knows how to treat Snowden

559
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,000
The University of Rostock wanted to award him an honorary doctorate, for example

560
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,560
And then the head of the university jumped in at the last minute

561
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,400
"That's not allowed

562
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,440
You can only get an award like that for scientific achievements"

563
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,460
And giving information to the media is not a scientific achievement

564
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,720
Do you know who got his honorary doctorate in Rostock?

565
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,980
Joachim Gauk [German president]

566
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,980
1999, do you know why?

567
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:37,440
For reworking databases

568
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,840
Yeah, Stasi documents

569
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,840
But you can't compare Snowden with Gauk

570
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,940
The University of Rostock would like their students to take this away:

571
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,820
"Become whistleblowers

572
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,820
but only when the regime you're denouncing

573
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:52,900
has already collapsed"

574
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,940
You can't trust anyone anymore, huh?

575
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,000
I can't be arsed

576
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,040
Always this bad news

577
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,640
from people in a bad mood,

578
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,040
in badly-fitting suits

579
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,420
I wish Klaus Kleber would say for once,

580
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,200
"Good evening and welcome to today's Journal

581
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,960
Nothing today, not even weather, good night"

582
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:35,300
I don't even know what's good and bad anymore

583
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,080
That was so easy before

584
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,340
Before, you knew

585
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,480
"American good

586
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,700
Russian bad"

587
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,080
"Nutella good,

588
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,180
Nusspli bad"

589
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,700
Nowadays it's not that simple

590
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,400
Barack Obama has a Nobel Peace Prize

591
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,420
and a trusted person

592
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:57,660
A trusted person who's spying on half the world

593
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,000
Who was given the Nobel Peace Prize

594
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,020
and is still running Guantanamo Bay on the side

595
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,620
2009, as he was inaugurated,

596
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:09,460
he said he'd close the thing within one year

597
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,140
The thing's still open

598
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,560
The only thing he did close

599
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:17,380
was the office responsible for resolving Guantanamo Bay

600
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,440
And in this wave of enthusiasm,

601
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,780
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize

602
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,420
when he had just 3 days earlier

603
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:29,500
sent 30,000 men and women to fight in Afghanistan

604
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,280
He shouldn't have got a peace prize for that

605
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,880
but an Oscar

606
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,660
Awarding Barack Obama the Nobel Peace Prize

607
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:40,260
is like restropectively presenting the terrorists of 9/11

608
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:46,420
with a prize for town planning

609
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:56,320
It's not that far-fetched

610
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,680
Mohammed Atta, one of the terrorists,

611
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,720
had studied town planning in Hamburg

612
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,740
Back then he said,

613
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:08,000
"I'll do something later with large buildings"

614
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,560
Who can I trust anymore?

615
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:16,060
Look at the ADAC [automobile association], that's a respectable joint

616
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:23,220
Now I know the Hells' Angels are more transparent

617
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,340
They falsified votes and voter participation so drastically

618
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:37,740
Kim Jong-un's ears would have gone red

619
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:45,760
On the other hand, now I know why they're called the "Yellow Angels"

620
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:52,840
They always pissed themselves laughing at their member's gullibility

621
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,500
Who can I trust?

622
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,760
Who can I trust?

623
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,980
OK, the Catholic church

624
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:07,300
They've been doing everything right for centuries

625
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,340
So the management up there is alright

626
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:16,760
The problem is the people on the ground

627
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:21,600
Cardinal Meisner ended his career with the words:

628
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,560
"One of your families is worth three Muslim families"

629
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,480
It's this integrative thought

630
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,480
that makes you wonder if they weren't smoking their insense

631
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,420
That poses the big question

632
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,940
Are they suffering from dementure

633
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:41,020
or rabies?

634
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,260
Who can I trust?

635
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:50,680
Look

636
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,860
I always used to trust advertising

637
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:56,520
Where they always said "Cats would buy Whiskers"

638
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,260
I stood in the supermarket for weeks

639
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,140
Not one cat came

640
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,560
And now I've learnt why

641
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,800
The cats on minimum wage

642
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,560
can't even afford Whiskers

643
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,720
On that note, welcome to today's Journal,

644
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:15,260
nothing today, not even weather

645
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,220
Herr Simon

646
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,200
I have to apologise to you

647
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,420
I will never make another dumb Dutchman joke

648
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,360
Would be nice, but why?

649
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,820
Because you're so courageous

650
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,200
Here I have this FIFA contract

651
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,300
which every land has to sign before it can host a world cup

652
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:41,180
And Holland was the only country brave enough to publish this contract

653
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,000
Yes

654
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Although, with your world cup tally

655
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,640
What did you have to lose?

656
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,680
Our conscience

657
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:55,220
You don't know it, it can't be bought

658
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,700
Do you still stand by your bet?

659
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,640
Yes

660
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,680
No

661
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,740
Yes, but look

662
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,160
This contract, from the FIFA

663
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,020
It's a contract for pure oppression

664
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:15,680
It places you outside of the host country's employment code

665
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,640
It's a license to exploit

666
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,240
Look here, in paragraph three:

667
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,840
They don't pay taxes

668
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,540
So FIFA doesn't pay any taxes

669
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:28,260
from the announcement of the host to the end of the world cup

670
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,500
The construction companies, the franchisees,

671
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,880
FIFA's trade partners, none of them pay tax

672
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,980
Neither do the sponsors

673
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,620
Companies worth millions invade a country,

674
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,520
dig out all the money,

675
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,680
and foist off the costs on the taxpayers

676
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,580
If you say yes one more time, do you know what I'll do with you?

677
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,120
No

678
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,360
But please explain, how can it be

679
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,460
that entire countries spread their legs when FIFA comes?

680
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,200
It's a non-profit organisation

681
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,420
with €1.4 billion reserves

682
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,540
And the officers are swimming in money

683
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,780
How the hell do they manage that?

684
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,740
That's very easy, FIFA has a product that everyone wants

685
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,260
but only they supply

686
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:07,120
Making money out of that is like shooting into an unguarded goalpost

687
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,040
Wait a minute

688
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,360
They have to sell the TV rights

689
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:15,380
And there must be some kind competition for that, right?

690
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,760
FIFA can't shut that out so easily

691
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,960
They can, for years they've sold the rights to the same intermediary

692
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,680
To the highest bidder

693
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,080
No, to the lowest

694
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,240
What kind of stragegy is that?

695
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,100
Because the one who bid the lowest

696
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,040
offered the officials the most

697
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,200
Over the years about €140m

698
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,440
- And that works?
- Yes

699
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,300
Like clockwork

700
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,680
I'd say that's a case for the courts

701
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,940
It's not like we're in a banana republic

702
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,100
Even worse: we're in Switzerland

703
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,580
What's that supposed to mean?

704
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,020
FIFA headquarters are in Switzerland

705
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,200
where until recently corruption by private persons

706
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,160
was not punishable

707
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,340
Private persons?  It's a billion-dollar business

708
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,040
It's a society

709
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,560
like pidgeon breeders

710
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,080
Only that they're breeding mice

711
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,540
Yes, and taxfree

712
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,160
I've had enough

713
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,160
I'm going to the police

714
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,640
Look, Interpol

715
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,280
Specialists in fighting corruption, they'll...

716
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,860
What are you doing?

717
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,240
That's the police!

718
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,120
And I'm FIFA and I've just donated €20m

719
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,180
FIFA donates €20m to Interpol?

720
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,500
Why?

721
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,420
That's pure corruption

722
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,240
That's fighting corruption

723
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:29,820
What?

724
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,880
Wait, FIFA gives the police money to fight corruption?

725
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,740
Not against FIFA

726
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:38,580
They should fight corruption in the Middle East or something

727
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,380
Preventative, or something like that

728
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,380
Gentlemen

729
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,480
I'm picking up a sense of distrust towards FIFA

730
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,560
I have a proposition for you

731
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,900
We'll get ourselves a neutral referee

732
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,960
Under one condition:

733
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,520
He can't look into our past

734
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,060
Otherwise something would come to light

735
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,060
Allow me to introduce to you

736
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:08,460
the investigator of our ethical commission, state prossecutor Michael Garcia

737
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,640
Wait a minute

738
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,160
He sounds familiar

739
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,640
He was in charge when the Leman Brothers' Bank collapsed

740
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:20,160
It was the worst supervision failure in the history of the American economy

741
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,360
Exactly our requirements

742
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,180
Expensive and incompetent

743
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,180
Don't you follow any rules?

744
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,680
We are the rules

745
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:33,480
Go play with yourself

746
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,680
We, the FIFA, prefer to play with ourselves

747
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,240
We establish our own laws

748
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,720
without waiting for foreign courts to show us the way

749
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,320
Sometimes you need to stay off-field

750
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,140
Now everyone's saying

751
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:03,740
we imposed enormous costs on the Brazilians for new stadiums

752
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,200
and I say

753
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,420
it's their own fault

754
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,200
There are other solutions

755
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,980
The next world cup is in Russia

756
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,260
And look at Vladimir Putin

757
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,260
He's already started annexing neighbouring countries

758
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:19,680
so he has enough stadiums by 2018

759
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,840
And of course there weren't any problems with demonstrations

760
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,700
I'm not worried about that

761
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:29,520
These female activists are the only ones who are protesting in Russa anyway

762
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,520
And female protestors

763
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,340
That's like women's football

764
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,600
Young, pretty creatures

765
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,120
floundering in a discipline

766
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,580
their bodies aren't designed for

767
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,760
"Pussy Riot"

768
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:56,220
That's what we call our shareholders' meeting after-party

769
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,140
"Pussy Riot" - what kind of outrageous name is that?

770
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:04,220
<i>[literal German translation]</i>

771
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:07,820
I once googled "pussy riot"

772
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:13,620
I got Frank Walter Steinmeier's Youtube clip

773
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:18,060
Putin won't let Alfons Hörmann ruin his beautiful world cup

774
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,740
When, after all those preparations,

775
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:24,580
he can finally stand proudly on the VIP stand

776
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:31,620
at the opening match in Warsaw

777
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,980
On his left side, his new life partner,

778
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,380
Gerhard,

779
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,820
the Carla Bruni of managed democracy

780
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,840
And on his right, my boss,

781
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:52,020
His Royal Delinquency, Joseph the First

782
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:55,060
Imagine this triarchy:

783
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,460
Schröder, Putin, Blatter

784
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:02,280
The id, the ego and the superego

785
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,920
They should invite Uli Hoeneß too, maybe

786
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,640
He'll be out of jail by then

787
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,660
And it'll put the critics in a more forgiving mood

788
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,200
and they can tell themselves, "Well

789
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:20,020
at least one of them has been in prison."

790
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,360
Uli Hoeneß is good at this PR thing

791
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:30,160
I said it from the start, denuncing himself

792
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,480
was a marketting strategy

793
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,780
He'd like to touch up his club's image

794
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,480
The Bavarians are always seen as bigwigs

795
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,440
They have the most money, the best players, the biggest wins

796
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,920
But also the sex appeal of Uschi Glas [German film and television actress]

797
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,100
Come on, she's sexy

798
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:55,480
It's a club like Sankt Pauli or 1816 Münchhen

799
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:02,260
They have a mongrel-like quality

800
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:07,160
which reminds you football is played below the belt

801
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:13,860
And that's why Hoeneß thought he'd get his club a bit of street cred

802
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:17,760
"Warrent of arrest" has the scent of the streets

803
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,680
Soon everyone will say "The Bavarians,

804
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,620
those are ghetto kickers"

805
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,160
The former president is an ex-con

806
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:41,200
And the sport director's an East German skinhead

807
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,720
He's a real ganster, Hoeneß, right?

808
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,440
In the space of just 4 days at court,

809
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,060
his tax due went from €3.5m

810
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:53,360
to €28.5m

811
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,400
Those are skyrocketing costs

812
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,040
So if he gets out of the slammer and the Bavarians don't want him back after all

813
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:08,620
he could still get a place on the parish council in Limburg

814
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:21,040
Ladies and gentlemen, my dear football fans,

815
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,180
Third World vs. First League:

816
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:26,560
The seamstresses from El Salvador are playing today

817
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,000
against their nemesis,

818
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,080
an Adidas shareholder

819
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:34,100
We're hoping for an exciting match

820
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,820
It's already so late

821
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,600
I sew 11 hours a day in the factory, but

822
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,180
Financially I'm making no mark

823
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,240
You can't imagine

824
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,600
How bad my day was

825
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,280
I'll say this much: shareholders' meeting

826
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,600
The whole time, feeding on the little guys

827
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,300
I've really put on weight, I think

828
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,980
That was the last bowl of rice

829
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,980
Well, I guess tomorrow we'll start

830
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,860
A rice diet!

831
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,920
That's what we'll have to do sometime

832
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,360
2 or 3 kilos

833
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,520
Rice

834
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,980
We could live off that for one or two weeks

835
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,840
But with the €160 I earn each month

836
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,820
You can't really get ahead, you know?

837
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:15,020
Recently, in the first quarter, Adidas only made €200m surplus

838
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:18,100
You know what the worst part is?

839
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,960
Wolf

840
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:24,960
€80m just because this stupid golf division isn't working in America

841
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,380
Out profits went up €800m nonetheless

842
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,620
We raised dividends

843
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:32,360
The shareholders should be happy, but

844
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,880
the seamstresses are being squeezed out like lemons

845
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,880
Always more, what more are we supposed to do?

846
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,880
Beating seamstresses

847
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,900
Yes, there are forewomen who beat seamstresses

848
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,900
When they don't manage to make enough items

849
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,680
You heard right, we were really beaten

850
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,940
by Nike

851
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,860
€2.5 billion

852
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:54,580
And we?

853
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:58,040
Can't even afford to eat properly from our wages

854
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,340
We have one last hope

855
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,940
A union

856
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:03,560
But we're not allowed to start one

857
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,380
Yeah

858
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,740
We'll always slip further and further

859
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,760
behind Nike

860
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,160
Brazil is our last chance

861
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,280
We have to get €2 billion our of the world cup, otherwise

862
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,940
We don't stand a chance

863
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:18,680
If you just say the world "union" you're on the black list

864
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:22,020
That's why we keep on doing forced overtime, even on holidays

865
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:26,200
There are mothers who often don't see their children for weeks

866
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,160
That's really...

867
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,100
Awesome

868
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:28,800
You know?

869
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,000
Because these national team jerseys sell like

870
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,540
Urinary tract infections

871
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:35,420
Yes

872
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,260
They raised our targets

873
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,240
300 jerseys a day

874
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,800
You only manage that without toilet breaks

875
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,300
And you only manage that by not drinking the whole day

876
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,260
Hence the infections

877
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:47,020
Yes, we really need a push

878
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:52,620
For the world cup, we're making one of the biggest campaigns in advertising history

879
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:56,020
One of my colleagues is now making a lecture tour in Germany

880
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,720
Maybe people there will notice

881
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,840
Oh yes, we were really dishing out money

882
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,240
Last year alone €1.5 billion for marketting

883
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,960
I would actually need three times as much as my current salary

884
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,040
to feed my family properly

885
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,600
But next year, we want to make a surplus of €1 billion

886
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,160
That would be good

887
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,680
It's working quite well with that world cup ball

888
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,080
People like that... What's it called again?

889
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,300
Estella Ramirez, is my friend's name

890
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:24,040
She's been fighting for years for better conditions for women in the factories

891
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,660
But you know what Adidas says to that?

892
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,040
Brazuca!  That's it!

893
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,660
Brazuca is that name of this Adidas world cup ball

894
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,980
Adidas has even written on its homepage,

895
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:34,440
"Well, when the wages are raised,

896
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,340
we shift our production to places

897
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,600
where wages are lower"

898
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,320
"Brazuca", you know what that means?

899
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,640
Warm-heartedness

900
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,140
Ladies and gentlemen, a high quality match, I thought

901
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,820
Fought with emotion

902
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:04,880
Let's hear what our FIFA official has to say about it

903
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,420
Herr Treter?

904
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,760
My apologies

905
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,840
That was nothing, Herr Uthoff

906
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,260
A couple of overpaid satirists

907
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:18,100
Collecting "concerned points" at the expense of fictional workers

908
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,500
Then your concern was fake?

909
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:23,220
Of course, but the fate behind it is real

910
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,380
That could be entirely possible

911
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:27,880
I'm told we have Estella Ramirez on the line

912
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,440
The connection is running

913
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:34,280
Dear viewers of the Establishment

914
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:38,840
I am Estella Ramirez from El Salvador

915
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:42,700
My colleagues and I

916
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:48,360
sew together your Adidas jerseys

917
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,860
The work...

918
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,660
I'm back

919
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:58,420
We were just experiencing problems with the connection, where were we?

920
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:04,400
With Estella Ramirez, a seamstress who spoke in Germany recently at the Adidas shareholders' meeting

921
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,100
How did that go?

922
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:07,320
Great

923
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,760
3 out of the 4 biggest shareholders left the room

924
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,600
I've had enough of Adidas

925
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,980
What do these shitty jerseys cost?

926
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:16,220
€79.95, and what do the seamstresses earn?

927
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,920
80c goes towards wages

928
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,040
1%

929
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,520
99% goes to the people who sell the jerseys,

930
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,620
who talk about them, or have their photo taken in them

931
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,980
Now I know what this absurd slogan means

932
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:29,540
Yeah, Adidas is raking it all in

933
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:30,560
Not entirely

934
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,660
According to media calculations, Adidas pays the most expensive player

935
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:37,860
€300,000 to wear their jersey

936
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,320
monthly

937
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,480
So to Adidas, a football player

938
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:44,440
is worth 2000 times more than a seamstress

939
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:48,380
Well, a football player like that is supposed to entertain millions of people

940
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:51,280
A seamstress can't even support her family

941
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:57,500
I've had enough

942
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,000
I've had enough

943
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I don't want to watch this world cup anymore

944
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:03,800
Me neither

945
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:08,120
Out jerseys are pinned together in Bangladesh

946
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,400
They wouldn't have won anyway

947
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,580
What are you doing, Frau Gruber?

948
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:11,120
Taking my jersey off

949
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,020
Wagner, you've won your stupid bet

950
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:15,180
And I'll gladly help you

951
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:17,200
Have fun with it in Amsterdam

952
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,720
Hold on, what's that?

953
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,100
I am now

954
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,000
a FIFA

955
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,820
A Female In Fair Apparel

956
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:24,360
Oh God

957
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,360
Yes, I want...

958
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,300
I want fair play

959
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,360
off the field, too

960
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,200
And not just at Adidas

961
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,200
but at Puma, Nike

962
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,360
We need to put pressure on the manufacturers

963
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,220
We're shooting down FIFA

964
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:48,220
with a critical goal wall shooting

965
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,500
Shoot away

966
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,860
As long as you watch football, we have the power

967
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:09,120
I'm done with that, I'm not watching

968
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,560
So, Herr von Wagner, I have to admit

969
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:15,940
You've won your stupid bet

970
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:30,080
Tell me, a football evening with no football is... What are we going to do now?

971
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:32,340
Come on, there's four of us

972
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:34,700
We have balls and even our own goal post

973
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:39,120
Come on, we're making our own world cup!

974
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:42,320
We're taking back football!

975
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:47,020
And we're throwing that out the window

976
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:50,080
Team revolution!

977
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,060
And because it's a fair world cup

978
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:57,560
the team wins who needs it the most!

979
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,660
That was the Establishment

980
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:07,680
Occupied today by...
